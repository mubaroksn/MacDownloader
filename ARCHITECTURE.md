# MacDownloader architecture

## Layout

```
Package.swift                     SwiftPM: DownloadCore (library) + MacDownloader (app) + tests
Sources/
  DownloadCore/                   UI-free engine. No AppKit/SwiftUI. Unit-testable.
    Models.swift                  SegmentState, RemoteRequest, RemoteResource, TransferProgress
    Errors.swift                  DownloadEngineError + transient/connection-failure classification
    HTTPHeaders.swift             Header hygiene (CR/LF stripping, reserved headers, identity encoding)
    ResourceProber.swift          Range probe (GET bytes=0-0) + per-transfer URLSession configuration
    SegmentPlanner.swift          Initial split + resume-data validation
    SegmentScheduler.swift        Work-stealing scheduler (reserve/commit, split, yield, ramp-up)
    FileSink.swift                F_PREALLOCATE + ftruncate + concurrent pwrite at offsets
    HTTPByteStream.swift          URLSession delegate → AsyncThrowingStream<Data> with backpressure
    RangeDownloader.swift         TaskGroup coordinator: workers + supervisor
  MacDownloader/
    App/                          @main, scenes (window, Settings, MenuBarExtra), CI snapshot hooks
    Downloads/                    DownloadManager (queue, persistence, sampling), DownloadItem
    Ingest/                       DownloadRequest + DownloadDispatching, LocalServer (Chromium bridge)
    System/                       SystemActivity (IOKit sleep assertion, App Nap)
    UI/                           SwiftUI views
Tests/DownloadCoreTests/          Unit tests + end-to-end tests against LocalRangeServer
ChromeExtension/                  MV3 extension (talks to LocalServer on 127.0.0.1:9614)
scripts/build_app.sh              Universal build → .app → .dmg (used by CI)
```

The rule: **DownloadCore knows nothing about the app**, and the app talks to the engine through
four calls: `ResourceProber.probe`, `RangeDownloader.init(... resumeFrom:)`, `run()`
(cancel the Task to pause), and `progress` / `snapshot()`.

## Data flow

                                   └─ supervisor: ends when workers finish, ramps connections back up
                                                                         │
                         fsync → rename .mdownload → final name → notify
```

## Engine design decisions

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| One `URLSession` (ephemeral, 1 conn/host) **per range request** | A shared session multiplexes all ranges for an HTTP/2 host onto one TCP connection, so N "connections" would share one congestion window and give no speed-up. |
| Delegate API bridged to `AsyncThrowingStream<Data>` instead of `URLSession.bytes` | `AsyncBytes` iterates one byte at a time; at 100 MB/s that burns a core. Chunks of 16–512 KB give one `pwrite` per chunk. |
| Backpressure: suspend task above 4 MB buffered, resume below 1 MB | URLSession delegate delivery has no flow control; this bounds memory per connection if the disk stalls (e.g. external HDD). |
| `pwrite` at offsets into one file, `F_PREALLOCATE` + `ftruncate` up front | No part files and no merge copy (half the disk I/O, no 2× free space). Full disk fails immediately. macOS has no `posix_fallocate`. |
| Temp file next to the destination (`.mdownload`) | Completion is an atomic same-volume `rename`, not a copy. |
| `reserve` / `commit` counters in the scheduler | Splits use reserved bytes (safe against in-flight writes); persistence uses committed bytes only, so a snapshot can never claim bytes that aren't on disk. |
| Work stealing (split the back half of the largest in-flight segment) | Fast connections finish early and take over from slow ones, so the tail of the download isn't one slow connection. |
| `If-Range` with strong ETag / Last-Modified | A file that changed on the server is restarted, never spliced. |
| `Accept-Encoding: identity` | Otherwise gzip/br changes the meaning of Content-Length and byte ranges. |
| Shed a connection on 429/503/connect failure, add one back per quiet interval | AIMD-style: settles at what the server tolerates instead of failing or hammering. |
| Progress is polled, not pushed | Workers update a lock-protected counter; the UI samples at 2 Hz only while something is transferring. No per-chunk main-thread hops. |

## Speed limit

`BandwidthLimiter` (DownloadCore) is one GCRA token scheduler shared by every connection of every
download. A worker calls `acquire(bytes)` after writing a chunk but *before* acknowledging it to
`HTTPByteStream`; while it waits, the stream buffer fills, the URLSession task is suspended and the
TCP window closes, so the cap holds on the wire. Changing the cap bumps a generation counter that
releases current waiters within 0.25 s. The app maps three modes (Penuh/Hemat/Senyap) to caps
stored in UserDefaults.

## Power

`SystemActivity` holds a `PreventUserIdleSystemSleep` IOKit assertion (display may still sleep)
and a `ProcessInfo` activity (opts out of App Nap) **only while a transfer is running**, and
releases both when the last one stops. CI verifies both states with `pmset -g assertions`.
The sampling timer has 200 ms tolerance and is invalidated when idle; the menu bar icon only
changes on state transitions.

## Browser integration roadmap

All entry points build a `DownloadRequest` and call `DownloadDispatching.enqueue`, so new sources
don't touch the queue.

- **Chromium (today):** MV3 extension → `POST 127.0.0.1:9614/add` → `LocalServer`.
- **Chromium Native Messaging (next):** a small command-line target speaking Chrome's
  4-byte-length-prefixed JSON over stdio, installed as
  `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/<name>.json`. It can forward
  to the running app over the existing localhost endpoint or an XPC service. Fits in SwiftPM as a
  second executable target, copied into `Contents/Helpers`.
- **Safari Web Extension:** requires an app extension (`.appex`) target, which SwiftPM cannot
  build. That is the point to move the app shell to an Xcode project (or XcodeGen/Tuist), keeping
  `DownloadCore` as a local Swift package. The extension's `SafariWebExtensionHandler` forwards to
  the app via an App Group container or XPC, creating `DownloadRequest(origin: .safariExtension)`.

## Testing

`swift test` runs on every CI build:

- Planner/scheduler/sink unit tests (tiling, stealing, reservation discard, yield rules, concurrent `pwrite`, disk-full).
- End-to-end against `LocalRangeServer` (real sockets): byte-exact parallel download with ≥ 4
  concurrent connections, pause/resume fetching only missing bytes, 429 throttling, ramp-up after
  recovery, no-range fallback, remote-change detection, probe failure.

CI then builds the universal app, runs a smoke test against a public server, captures UI
screenshots and checks the power assertion.
